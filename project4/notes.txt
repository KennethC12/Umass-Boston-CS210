1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
This project is about creating a program that solves a sliding puzzle game known as the 8-puzzle, 
which could also work for similar puzzles of different sizes. 
Imagine a small square frame that holds 9 tiles, one of which is missing, 
allowing the others to slide around within the frame. 
The tiles are numbered, and the goal is to move them around until they are in numerical order.
