1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   In this project, we aim to develop a symbol table for managing two-dimensional spatial data using points as keys. 
   We will implement two distinct data types: BrutePointST and KdTreePointST. Each type supports efficient spatial queries such as range search and k-nearest neighbor search.
   

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
