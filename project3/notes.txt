1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   This version of project was about AutoComplete. AutoComplete is to finish what the person is trying to write.
   For example in these IDEs, when typing you are able to autocomplete the word that you are trying write. 
   The API for terms that was given to us was about comparing
   terms by three different orders: lexicographic order by query; in descending order by weight; and lexicographic order by query
   but using only the first r characters.
   This project also used an sorted array for the binary search.
   In this the autocomplete.java part, I was able to implement a data type that provides autocomplete functionality for a
   given set of string and weights, using Term and BinarySearchDeluxe.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
